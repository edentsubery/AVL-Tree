# AVL-Tree
A comprehensive implantation of a data structure named AVL Tree as I was asked to make during the data structures course.
AVL Tree is a data structure that keeps binary trees balanced, making them work in O(log n) in WC. It uses rebalancing methods like rotations that you can find in the code.
